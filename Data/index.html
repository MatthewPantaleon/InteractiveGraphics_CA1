				<h3>Income By County (2000 - 2015)</h3>
				<p>Shows The Total Disposable Income per year.</p>
				<p>The graph shows when the recession hit in 2008. Some of the worst hit counties include: Donegal, Monaghan, Offaly and Roscommon. Counties not so much affected are: Dublin, Meath and Kildare.</p>
				<p>Let's take a closer look at these counties and how the lower income affected thier crime rates.</p>

				<h3>Burglary By County (2003 - 2015)</h3>
				<p>Burglary Crimes committed in each county each year. No Data from 2000 to 2002.</p>
				
				<p>We can immediately see burglary rates in Limerick are always above average as well as Kildare's. Dublin's crime rate is substatially larger due to its population.</p>
				<p>We see a common trend in all counties where in 2008 and 2009 crime rates rise by a lot. With some exceptions for Kerry and Sligo. Where Crime rates are steady.</p>

				<h3>Fraud By County (2003 - 2015)</h3>
				<p>Fraud Crimes committed in each county each year. No Data from 2000 to 2002.</p>
				<p>We see that Donegal's fraud rates have virtually stayed the same. Actually decreasing as the years go by even though their average income is consistently below average. Either people are smarter about their fraud or really less people are commiting fraud. Similar correlation with Laois.</p>

				<h3>Theft By County (2003 - 2015)</h3>
				<p>Theft Crimes committed in each county each year. No Data from 2000 to 2002.</p>
				<p>Galway leading up to the recession, theft rates have increased. This could be partyl due to it having a large college population. Donegal's theft rates increased during the recession.</p>
